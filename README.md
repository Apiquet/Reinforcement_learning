# Reinforcement Learning

## Common strategies
 
The project is explained [here](https://apiquet.com/2021/02/07/reinforcement-learning/)

* qlearning_FrozenLake.ipynb notebook explore q-learning technique in FrozenLake openai gym environment:

* A neural network was also used to teach an agent to land on a specific position. The following agent was trained for 3k episodes:

* The same architecture was used in the CartPole openai gym environment where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track:

The architecture and methods of the agent have been designed to adapt to other open gym environments.

## Implementation of Deep Mind DQN [IN PROGRESS]

The project is explained [here](https://apiquet.com/2021/11/12/playing-atari-with-deep-reinforcement-learning/)

It explains how to build a neural network to play Atari games.
